## Where to start?

The file [Lorenti2023](Slides/2023__lorenti__phd_research_activity.pdf) represents a good starting point, as it provides an overview of all my research activity, up to March 2023.
The file is a presentation, and further details can be found in the other documents.

## Renewable Energy Communities

Renewable Energy Communities (RECs), their modelling and optimization represents great part of my research.
The file [Lorenti2022](Unpublished/2022__lorenti__modelling_and_optimisation_of_renewable_energy_communities_as_multi_energy_systems.pdf) provides a general overview of this topic, up to September 2022.

### Energy flows optimization

[Gulli2022](Preprints/preprint__2022__gulli_et_al__recoupled_a_simulation_tool_for_renewable_energy_communities_coupling_electric_and_thermal_energies.pdf) and [Lazzeroni2022](Preprints/preprint__2022__lazzeroni_et_al__modeling_of_renewable_energy_communities_the_recoupled_approach.pdf) present a thorough description of the mathematical formulation of the energy flows (deterministic) optimization in RECs, using Mixed-Integer-Linear-Programming.

### Software implementation

I put a lot effort (often, unsuccessfully) to implement my research into free codes. A completely open-source software about the optimization of simple, electricity RECs can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cadema-PoliTO/RECOpt). A more advanced code involving multiple nodes and energy vectors, whose details can be found in [Lazzeroni2022](Preprints/preprint__2022__lazzeroni_et_al__modeling_of_renewable_energy_communities_the_recoupled_approach.pdf) will be hopefully made available. A beta version can be obtained by contacting me [here](mailto:gianmarco.lorenti@polito.it).

### Applications and case studies

The application of the REC framework to a real case study of a municipal REC in Piedmont can be found in [Cantalupa2021](Unpublished/2021__lorenti__et_al__preliminary_results_of_the_performance_analysis_of_the_rec_in_cantalupa.pdf) (in Italian).
[Gulli2022](Preprints/preprint__2022__gulli_et_al__recoupled_a_simulation_tool_for_renewable_energy_communities_coupling_electric_and_thermal_energies.pdf) reports three case studies of electricity-thermal RECs in a multifamily residential buildings, analysis that has been spread nation-wide in [Canova2022](Preprints/preprint__2022__canova_et_al__decarbonizing_decarbonizing_residential_energy_consumption_under_the_italian_collective_self_consumption_regulation.pdf).

### Revenues sharing

RECs are intersting for energy consumers as they bring, among the others, economical benefits. But how to re-distribute these benefits among REC members? An attempt to using Game Theory has been made in [Lorenti2023](Unpublished/2023__lorenti_value_sharing_in_renewable_energy_communities_an_open_issue.pdf) and compared to a simple heurstic algorithm.
